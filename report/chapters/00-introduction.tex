Each year, we produce more data than the previous one. All those datas are stored in multiple datacenters spread all over the world. Those datacenters require a lot of energy to maintain bits of information in spinning disks, tapes, capacities, transistors, ...

The Independent reported in 2016 that data centers will consume three times as much energy as they are currently using over the course of the next decade. \cite{bib:data_storage_impact}

It becomes naturally important to find more eco-friendly ways to store data.
