\section{DNA latent representation}

In this section, we will plug all parts together in order to implement a latent representation of DNA. With these pieces of DNA strands, we will be able to synthesis and encapsulate them in a real medium to preserve them.

The first step in order to achieve this is to extract the features of the point clouds with the analysis transform of the model presented previsously.
