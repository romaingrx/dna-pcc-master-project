In this work, we will try to build an end-to-end point cloud compression model for quatarnary based entropy coding. 

We will first discover the state of the art of compression models for point cloud that leads to the best bitrates for various point clouds and then adapt it to output \ACGT{} symbols instead of the classical $0$ and $1$ binary base.

Then we will have to study the state of the art of DNA based storage and how we can store our long sequence of \ACGT{} in the most efficient way to minimise the cost of storing those datas while trying to recover the compressed point cloud in the most XXXX way.
For this last part, we will have to study the influence of each parameters to store the DNA strand as small chunks in a solution. At the end, we will have to propose the best parameters to store a DNA strand for a certain period of time.

And finally, we will have to provide the reconstruct model to go from the compressed version to the point cloud as closed as possible from the original one.
