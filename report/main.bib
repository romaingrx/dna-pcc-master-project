To reduce the error probabilities of these techniques, DNA composition has to adhere to method-dependent restrictions. To comply with such restrictions, a synthetic DNA fragment is often adjusted manually or by using custom-made scripts. In this article, we present MESA (Mosla Error Simulator), a web application for the assessment of DNA fragments based on limitations of DNA synthesis, amplification, cloning, sequencing methods and biological restrictions of host organisms. Furthermore, MESA can be used to simulate errors during synthesis, PCR, storage and sequencing processes.MESA is available at mesa.mosla.de, with the source code available at github.com/umr-ds/mesa\_dna\_sim.dominik.heider@uni-marburg.deSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Given that the information medium is DNA itself, its stability under different storage and processing conditions will fundamentally impact and constrain design considerations and data system capabilities. Here we analyze the storage conditions, molecular mechanisms, and stabilization strategies influencing DNA stability and pose specific design configurations and scenarios for future systems that best leverage the considerable advantages of DNA storage.},
